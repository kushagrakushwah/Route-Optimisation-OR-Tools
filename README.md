## 📖 About The Project
[cite_start]This project addresses complex **Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP)** for multiple depots using Constraint Programming (CP-SAT)[cite: 24, 25]. [cite_start]It is designed to optimize delivery paths and improve operational scalability for logistics scenarios involving 50+ nodes simultaneously[cite: 25].

[cite_start]By integrating Machine Learning heuristics to analyze demand patterns, this engine significantly improves route prediction accuracy compared to standard algorithmic approaches[cite: 27].

## ✨ Key Features
* [cite_start]**Multi-Depot Optimization:** successfully models and solves routing complexities for multiple starting points and over 50 destination nodes[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Cost Reduction:** Implements constraints that reduce theoretical travel distance by **35%**, directly impacting fuel efficiency[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**ML-Assisted Heuristics:** Utilizes machine learning to analyze demand patterns, enhancing prediction accuracy by **15%**[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Scalable Architecture:** Capable of handling complex constraints including vehicle capacities and time windows[cite: 26].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]**Solver:** Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT) [cite: 25, 28]
* [cite_start]**Concepts:** Operations Research, Machine Learning, Graph Theory [cite: 28, 38]
